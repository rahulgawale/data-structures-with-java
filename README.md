# Data Structures With Java
Hello there! I am trying to recreate data structures with Java for practice and better understanding. I am referring to William Fiset's YouTube series on data structure to recreate these examples. I am sharing this code in order to help learners like me.

I have added a class for each data structure and related example with main method so you can play around it.
FIle structure is like below, consider an example dyanamic Array.
1. `Array.java` - A class for implementation of an array.
2. `ArrayExamples.java` - a class with main function to demonstrate the implementation with examples.
